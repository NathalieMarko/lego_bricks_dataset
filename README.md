# LEGO Bricks Dataset: Defect Recognition

This project applies deep learning techniques to recognize defects using the LEGO Bricks dataset. The goal is to develop and evaluate models for accurate defect detection and recognition in images.

## Project Structure

- `lego_dataset_preparation.pynb` — Initial data exploration and preprocessing.
- `Lego_defect_classification.ipynb` — Transfer learning experiments for defect recognition.
- `help_func.py` — Helper functions for data processing and modeling.
- `data/` — (Not included) Large datasets used for training and evaluation.

## Key Features

- Data preprocessing fitting the desired folders structure for image recognition tasks.
- Transfer learning with state-of-the-art neural networks.
- Model evaluation and visualization of results.
- Well-documented Jupyter notebooks for reproducibility.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository.
2. Download the required datasets sSourse: https://zenodo.org/records/10731976.
3. Run the notebooks in order for a full walkthrough of the project.

## Results

- Achieved high accuracy in license plate recognition using transfer learning.
- Demonstrated the effectiveness of data augmentation and model tuning.
