# LEGO Bricks Dataset: Defect Recognition

This project applies deep learning techniques to recognize defects using the LEGO Bricks dataset. The goal is to develop and evaluate models for accurate defect detection and recognition in images.

## Project Structure

- `lego_dataset_preparation.pynb` — Initial data exploration and preprocessing.
- `Lego_defect_classification.ipynb` — Transfer learning experiments for defect recognition.
- `data/` — (Not included) Large datasets used for training and evaluation.

## Key Features

- Data preprocessing fitting the desired folders structure for image recognition tasks.
- Transfer learning with state-of-the-art neural networks.
- Model evaluation and visualization of results.
- Well-documented Jupyter notebooks for reproducibility.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository.
2. Download the required datasets (sourse: https://zenodo.org/records/10731976).
3. Run the notebooks in order for a full walkthrough of the project.

## Results

- Achieved high precision 0.87 in defect recognition for class 'defect'.
- Demonstrated the effectiveness of using transfer learning from pretraines Resnet18 model.
